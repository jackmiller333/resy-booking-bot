# BufferDays #
##############
# Custom config for calculating the date when we want the reservation. This value should be the number of days from
# the time the bot to the date of the requested reservation. This makes it so the config can be run say over day 
# without being updated.
# e.g.
# bufferDays.days=30
bufferDays.days=30

######################
# ReservationDetails #
######################
# The date you want to make the reservation in YYYY-MM-DD format. This should be set to the day after the
# last available day with restaurant reservations as this is the day you want to snipe for a reservation once they
# become available.
# e.g.
# resDetails.date="2099-01-30"
resDetails.date="2023-02-23"
# Size of the party reservation
# e.g.
# resDetails.party-size=2
resDetails.party-size=4
# The unique identifier of the restaurant you want to make the reservation at. Can be found when viewing
# available reservations for a restaurant as a query parameter in the `/find` API call if you have the web console open.
# e.g.
# resDetails.venue-id=123
resDetails.venue-id=2567
# Priority list of reservation times and table types. Time is in military time HH:MM:SS format. This
# allows full flexibility on your reservation preferences. For example, your priority order of reservations can be...
#   * 18:00 - Dining Room
#   * 18:00 - Patio
#   * 18:15
#   If you have no preference on table type, then simply don't set it and the bot will pick a reservation for that time
#   slot regardless of the table type.
# e.g.
# resDetails.res-time-types=[
#     {reservation-time="18:00:00", table-type="Dining Room"},
#     {reservation-time="18:00:00", table-type="Patio"},
#     {reservation-time="18:15:00"}
# ]

    {reservation-time="19:00:00", table-type="Indoor Dining Room"},
